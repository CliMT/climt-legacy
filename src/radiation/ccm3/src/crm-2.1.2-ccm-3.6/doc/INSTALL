CCM3 Column Radiation Model (CRM) Installation Guide:

The CRM only supports machine architectures supported by the CCM.
The currently supported architectures are the Sun, SGI and Cray
flavors of UNIX. In the following instructions, the string `***'
prefixes the sample commands. Before attempting to build the CRM, be
sure you have netCDF version 3.x installed. The netCDF homepage is
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf.  

Copy the CRM compressed tarfile to the parent of the installation
directory. Assume the file is called crm.tar.gz. 
Substitute your choice for the installation directory for `/home/user'
in the following. 
*** mv crm.tar.gz /home/user

Move to the same directory as the distribution file
*** cd /home/user

Uncompress and untar the source code. By default, the CRM distribution
unpacks into a subdirectory with a long name, e.g., crm-2.0-ccm-3.6
(the version number for public releases) or crm-19980815 (the date for
a daily snapshot). This directory will be created if it does not
exist.    
*** gtar -xvzf crm.tar.gz 

If you do not have GNU tar, use the following commands instead
*** gunzip crm.tar.gz
*** tar -xvf crm.tar

This (rather long) directory name is not useful to most people, so
you might want to move the entire directory to something easier to
type, e.g., crm.
*** mv crm-2.0-ccm-3.6 crm

Move to the build directory 
*** cd crm/bld

Typing `make' at this point just might work. If it does work, the
CRM executable file 'crm' will be placed in the crm/bin
directory. If this does not work, you have two options. The preferred
option is to edit the Makefile so that it supports your local
environment, and then type `make' again. Use the `pvmgetarch' command
to determine which block of symbols the Makefile is using (i.e.,
SUNMP, CRAY, SGI64), then edit the default symbols for that
architecture to suit your system. Usually, the only part of the
Makefile that needs to be changed is the location of the netCDF
installation. These is done by editing the variables NETCDF_INC and
NETCDF_LIB at the start of the block of code for your machine's
architecture (as defined by `pvmgetarch').

If you get this procedure working on an architecture not currently in
the Makefile, please send us the necessary modifications to include
your architecture in future version of the CRM. The `Filepath' file
specifies the location and order of the directories containing the CRM
source files. If your machine type is CRAY, you may safely remove the
../src/srchutil directory, as it only duplicates routines from the
default Cray libraries anyway. NB: `Makefile' only works with the GNU
make program.  
*** make 

The second way to compile the CRM is to execute a variant of the
following one line shell command. First, determine the preprocessor
token corresponding to your machine type. One of the following three
valid tokens must be defined at CRM compile time: SUN, CRAY, or
SGI. The token is normally defined by editing the file
crm/src/crm/misc.h. Defining the token on the compile line
(e.g., with -DSUN, as shown in the next step) is also permissable. Be
sure only one of SUN, CRAY, and SGI is defined. The following command
works with Sun f77:

*** cd crm/src
*** f77 -DSUN -DSINGLE_SOURCE_FILE -Icrm -Iccmlsm_share -Icontrol -Icsm_share -Idom -Ieul -Iphysics -Isrchutil -I/contrib/include -O -e -r8 -i4 -o ../bin/crm crm/crm.F -L/contrib/lib -lnetcdf 

The purpose of each switch is:
   f77 is the Fortran compiler. Other names might be f90, cf90.
   -DSUN tells C preprocessor to code branches appropriate for Sun computers
   -DSINGLE_SOURCE_FILE causes the entire CRM to be compiled within crm.F
   -Icrm -Iccmlsm_share ... tells C preprocessor which order and where to search for CRM input files that are #include'd
   -I/contrib/include tells C preprocessor where to find netcdf.inc file
   -e allows 132 column Fortran source files
   -r8 -i4 tells Fortran compiler to promote floats to double precision (real*8)
   -o ../bin/crm tells compiler what to call the resulting executable
   crm/crm.F is the main CRM source file (it #include's all other files)
   -L/contrib/lib tells linker where to find libnetcdf.a library
   -lnetcdf tells linker to link to libnetcdf.a library

As of CRM 2.1 (1999/09/07), CRM uses some Fortran 90 code within
the CRM_SRB blocks. Users of Sun f77 should make sure this code is 
not invoked by #undef'ing the CRM_SRB token in src/crm/misc.h.
Since the Sun f90 compiler does not allow promotion of variables from
real to double precision, the netCDF output file crm.nc will 
contain garbage. There is no satisfactory way to compile the full CRM
2.1 with Sun compilers.

If you are working with an unsupported operating system (e.g., AIX),
you will most likely need to find an analogous switch for each of the
above options. Hint: The CRM is most likely to compile on unsupported
operating systems when the machine type is specified as SGI, i.e., use
-DSGI combined with the particular compiler switches for your OS.

At this point you should have a working CRM executable named `crm' in
the crm/bin directory. Run the CRM on the supplied sample input
file.
*** cd ../data
*** ../bin/crm < mls_clr.in

Validate your CRM against the supplied radiation profile. The supplied
profile was created on a Sun Solaris system (differences with your
answers should be within machine precision).    
*** ../bin/crm < mls_clr.in > tst_clr.out
*** diff -w tst_clr.out mls_clr.out | more
*** ../bin/crm < mls_cld.in > tst_cld.out
*** diff -w tst_cld.out mls_cld.out | more

There are some "targets" in the Makefile which help with
housekeeping. If you are done compiling, you may want to remove all 
the object files (`make clean') or you may want to remove all files
created during the installation procedure, including the executable
(`make distclean').
*** make clean
*** make distclean

You are done.
